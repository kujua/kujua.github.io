<p><strong>Many developers were waiting for the announcements of new computers and operating systems to decide which company to give their money. I did too and I am a little bit confused.</strong></p>

<h2 id="the-present">The Present</h2>

<p>For many developers the choice was clear for a long time. If one has to use <em>.NET</em> or <em>WPF</em> or similar you get a machine with <em>Windows</em> pre-installed. Any other operating systems go into a virtual machine. This setup is most likely used when creating backend solutions or web applications with Microsoft technology.</p>

<p>When web applications got more client heavy with JavaScript frameworks providing features that were before more used in backend driven applications the situation changed slightly. Now web developers were more inclined to use a <em>nix machine. some *Ubuntu</em>, many more <em>Mac OS</em>.</p>

<h2 id="my-own-setup">My own setup</h2>

<p>After m y last project based on <em>.NET</em> I changed completely to the Mac. The main reason was to be able to implement an iOS application when needed. Also, with virtual machines or dual boot it is possible to have all operating system worlds on one machine.</p>

<h2 id="what-do-i-need">What do I need?</h2>

<p>The current situation got me thinking what I actually need reagarding hardware and software:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fast enough machine for compilations with at least four real cores, that means Quad Core i7 upwards.</li>
  <li>At least 16 GB of RAM. More is better, but with having databases and similar running in Docker containers the RAM is not so crucial.</li>
  <li>Graphics card can be one of the Intel built in, on a developer machine for my purposes I donâ€™t care for graphics. As long as it can play videos in HD I am fine. There is one aspect that has to do with powerful GPUs and we will see later that then the GPU in the devloepr machine is of consequence.</li>
  <li>Connectivity is important: at least three USB 3 ports and HDMI. Nice is also VGA (I know, but many projectors still have only those or there is only a VGA monitor to connect to) and a card reader.</li>
  <li>There must be a stable VM solution available - Virtualbox was never working well for me.</li>
  <li>All development software like editors, IDEs and used frameworks must run on the operating system and must be maintained on that operating system as well.</li>
</ul>

<p>At this moment the following software is relevant for my work on the computer - I leave out obvious software like <em>Chrome</em>:</p>
