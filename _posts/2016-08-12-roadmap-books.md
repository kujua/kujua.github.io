**My planned books until end 2017**

After publishing the Erlang/Elixir book I am working now on the book "Web Applications with Elm".

The following books are planned:

* Starterkit Series: Hacking editors - A free book that goes hand in hand with the start of my upcoming advanced developer training courses in European countries. The book goes into developing add-ons or packages for the editors *Atom*, *Visual Studio Code*, *IntelliJ* and *Sublime*.
* Starterkit Series: Elixir/Phoenix and Angular 2 - This book describes the integration of an Angular 2 frontend with a Phoenix backend.
* Software Engineering Series: Functional Languages
* Actor Model - From Theory to Implementation
